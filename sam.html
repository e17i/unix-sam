In Kernighan's book <i>UNIX: a history and a memoir</i>, he mentions the
editor <i>sam</i>, which seems to have been in use by many well known
members of the IT scene. So, when reading that book, I got curious and
did a few experiments with this editor.
</p>

<p>
It was quite an interesting experience. One of my first impressions
was, this is almost like a <i>vi</i> of an alternate reality. <i>Vi</i> takes
the commands and concepts of the <i>ed</i> editor from the command line to
visual editing; <i>sam</i> does almost the same, but in a completely
different way. It uses a GUI (by means of X11), but within that, it
presents a command window (besides having actual text file windows).
There you work like on a command line, issuing almost <i>ed</i>-like
commands. But you must use the mouse to select regions, shift windows
and use the menu to cut and paste or repeat commands.
</p>

<div id="org38afb2a" class="figure">
<p><img src="./sam.png" alt="sam.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>The <i>sam</i> editor.</p>
</div>

<p>
In difference to <i>vi</i>, that command language has been developed into
an interesting direction<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. Of this development, two features should be
mentioned here. First, instead of working with single lines of text,
the commands have been adopted to work with blocks or regions of text,
and second, the commands can be stacked together. So for example, you
can formulate a regexp repeatedly selecting text blocks, like
paragraphs. Then, for each of these selections, the next regexp can
select sub-elements, like single sentences. And finally, you can use
single commands or command sets working with or modifying that
innermost current selection. Afterwards, the larger selection of the
previous level is re-established and that level's iteration
continues.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here is a regexp matching a python function: it matches
regions starting with a <i>def</i> keyword in the first column, then
continues as long as it finds indented or empty lines. Using this
regexp as a command works as known from <i>vi</i>, selecting the next
matching region.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">/^def.+: *\n(^ +.*\n|^ *\n)+/
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <i>x</i> command, applied to a region (here, we use the shortcut
for <i>0,$</i> selecting all of the current file, <i>","</i>), is an iterator
consecutively selecting each of the matches and then executing the
following command on a new region defined by this selection. The <i>p</i>
command just prints the current selection to the command window.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">,x/^def.+: *\n(^ +.*\n|^ *\n)+/ p
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <i>y</i> command is an iterator selecting each part of the current
region not matching it's regexp. So the following combination selects
each python function, then for each selects the parts outside of possible
docstrings, then prints each of them.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">,x/^def.+: *\n(^ +.*\n|^ *\n)+/ y/^ *<span class="org-string">"""(.|\n)*"""</span>/ p
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So this idea of structural regexps seems really interesting to me. On
the other side, the way the GUI part of <i>sam</i> is working is totally
uncommon nowadays. And I'd like to have more control over selecting
windows or addressing different windows within the same command (like
using the region of one window as input of a command and another
window as output).
</p>

<p>
But I don't want this experiment to get so far out of hand as to hack
into the source of <i>sam</i>.
To still continue experiments with these kinds of regexps,
I did a small script called [[ssam][]], accessing
<i>sam</i> as a stream editor from the command line. But beware, this is
just a simple proof of concept without any sanity checks and so on. It
has been developed on NetBSD, so for running it on linux flavors, it
might need some tweaks.
The script takes a text piped in, loading it into a <i>sam</i> instance
started without GUI, sending the given commands to it and finally
piping the modified editor contents out to stdout. As an alternative,
you can specify commands printing out selections, so the result piped
out should be these prints instead of the (probably unmodified) editor
contents. To do this, you can use the "-p" option.
</p>

<p>
Using this script, you could pipe in a python file and use the <i>sam</i>
command shown above:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">cat myfile.py | ssam -p <span class="org-string">",x/^def.+: *\n(^ +.*\n|^ *\n)+/ y/^ *\"\"\"(.|\n)*\"\"\"/ p"</span> | less
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And, continuing my experiments, a final example, also showing the
syntax to apply more then one command. This again selects python
functions, and then, on each selection, applies two independent
commands. The first one selects the first line of the current
selection (the function definition) and prints it. The second one,
again having the original selection as input, selects the docstring
inside of the selected python function (if there is one) and prints that. 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">cat myfile.py | ssam -p <span class="org-string">",x/^def.+: *\n(^ +.*\n|^ *\n)+/ {</span>
<span class="org-string">                             -+p</span>
<span class="org-string">                             x/^ *\"\"\"(.|\n)*\"\"\"\n/ p</span>
<span class="org-string">                         }"</span> | less
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So I'm really looking forward to finding applications of using this
way of structural stream editing in my shell scripts.
